## Abstract 1/2

Consider the following two-player game. Let \\(W\\) be some subset of the reals.
During the initial round, Alice chooses \\(-\infty\\) and Bob chooses
\\(+\infty\\). Then each subsequent move of either player is a real number
strictly between the two most recently chosen numbers.
After \\(\omega\\)-many rounds, Alice wins this game provided that some number
in \\(W\\) is both greater than all her choices and less than all Bob's choices.

## Abstract 2/2

Bob has a winning strategy in this game if and only if \\(W\\) is countable.
To see this, we will demonstrate two proofs accessible to a general mathematical 
audience, one utilizing countable elementary submodels, and the other involving
limited information strategies.
